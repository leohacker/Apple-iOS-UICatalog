Apple-iOS-UICatalog
===================

The UICatalog project from official Apple Developer Center Sample Code - iOS8

The source code was downloaded from Apple Developer Center, and a license is included in the project folder. Please refer that license declaration if you would use the source code in your project. Since the source code is open and distributed for developer to study, so I assume it's fine to push these code here and share with others. Hi, Apple, please let me know if you feel this is inappropriate.

The Objective-C and Swift version are included in the source code tree in respective folder. The code in this repository, was just updated in 2014-12-10. So the code should be compliant to iOS 8.1, XCode 6.1.
